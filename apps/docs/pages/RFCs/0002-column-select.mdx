# Column Preselection Interface for Data Cleaning Workflow

## Purpose

Currently, users upload XLSX files and are taken directly to the cleaning page where they must configure column types and formats during the cleaning process. This creates cognitive overhead and makes the cleaning workflow less efficient. We need a more streamlined approach that allows users to configure columns upfront before starting the actual cleaning process.

## Background

The existing workflow:
1. User uploads XLSX file
2. System processes and stores file data in DatacleanerFile table
3. User is immediately taken to cleaning interface
4. Column types and formats are configured during cleaning

This approach has several limitations:
- Users must context switch between cleaning and configuration
- No clear separation between setup and cleaning phases
- Harder to track which columns need cleaning
- Configuration changes during cleaning can be disruptive

## Proposal

Add an intermediary modal step after file upload but before the cleaning page:

1. After successful file upload, show a modal with:
   - List of detected columns from the file
   - Toggle buttons to select/deselect columns for cleaning
   - Dropdown to preselect data type for each column
   - Preview of first few rows of data

2. Only selected columns will be available for cleaning in the next step

3. Pre-selected data types will be saved and applied automatically

# Technical Details

## Schema Changes

Update the ColumnSchema to include:
```typescript
export const ColumnSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  name: z.string(), 
  cellOrder: z.array(z.string()),
  type: ColumnTypeSchema.optional(),
  format: z.string().optional(),
  isUpdated: z.boolean().optional(),
  isSelected: z.boolean().optional(), // New field
});
```

## API Changes

New tRPC mutations:
```typescript
// Bulk update columns
bulkUpdateColumns: protectedProcedure
  .input(z.object({
    fileId: z.string(),
    columns: z.array(z.object({
      id: z.string(),
      isSelected: z.boolean(),
      type: ColumnTypeSchema,
    }))
  }))
  .mutation(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
      // Logic goes in here
  })
```


## Implementation Plan

Phase 1: Basic Column Selection
- Implement database schema changes
- Create basic modal UI with column toggling
- Add navigation flow from upload to modal to cleaning page

Phase 2: Type Preselection
- Add type selection dropdowns
- Implement type persistence
- Update cleaning page to respect preselected types

Phase 3: Preview & UX Improvements
- Add data preview functionality
- Implement bulk selection/deselection
- Add column search/filtering
- Add validation and error handling

Phase 4: Analytics & Optimization
- Track usage patterns
- Optimize performance
- Add column type suggestions based on content

## General Questions

Q: Will this affect existing files in the system?
A: No, existing files will maintain their current behavior. The new workflow will only apply to newly uploaded files.

Q: Can users modify their column selection later?
A: Yes, we'll provide an option to modify column selection from the cleaning interface, but it will require confirmation to prevent accidental changes.

Q: How will this impact performance?
A: The additional step adds minimal overhead as we're using existing data. The benefit of reduced cleaning scope outweighs the small delay.
