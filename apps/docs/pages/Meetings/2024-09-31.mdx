## Summary

- The team is aiming to launch the product in mid-October (week of October 14-18)

    - The team decided to go with the simple MVP without suggestive features to meet the deadline
- The team will gather feedback on designs from Excel Dictionary's audience before final development
- Brand identity will follow Excel Dictionary's minimal style with white and hints of green
